# 🐾 Cats Café

Cats Café is a fictional single-page application for a cat-themed farmer’s café — home to 50 adorable cats, each looking for a new family. Visitors can interact with the animals: pet, play, and take photos. The app also allows users to explore the café and purchase tickets for a visit.

## 🗂️ About the Project

The application consists of:

- 🏠 **Main Page** — an introduction to the café and a featured list of cats
- 🖼️ **Gallery Page** — built with the Swiper library, showcasing the café interior and cats
- 🎟️ **Ticket Purchase Section** — users can select ticket type and visit duration
- ⚙️ **SPA Structure** — built as a Single Page Application using React Router

During development, the following challenges were solved:

- Building React components using **JSX**
- Styling UI using **Styled Components** (CSS-in-JS)
- Creating interactive components with state and dynamic rendering
- Setting up **routing and navigation** between app sections

> The project does **not include responsive layout** — it is optimized for desktop screens only.
